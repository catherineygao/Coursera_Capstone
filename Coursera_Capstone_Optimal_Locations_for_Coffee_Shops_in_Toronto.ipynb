Toronto is one of the major cities in Canada as well as the most populous metropolitan area. Opening a coffee shop in this city represents business opportunity but also strong competition at the same time. This project will explore clusters of neighborhoods in Toronto to recommend locations for a good coffee shop business.  \n",
